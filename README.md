# Exercise: Testing model performance
Â© ExploreAI Academy

In this exercise, we will use the train-test split technique to separate a dataset into training and testing sets and use them to train and test the performance of a model.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this train, you should be able to:
* Create separate train and test sets for both the predictor and response variables.
* Train a model on the training data.
* Assess and compare the model's performance on both the training and testing sets.
